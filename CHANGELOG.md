    * Lunar will ask for accessibility permissions to enable this functionality
    * Instructions: 
        * Press keyboard brightness keys while the cursor is on an external monitor to change the brightness on that monitor 
        * Press Control + keyboard brightness keys to adjust contrast 
        * Press keyboard volume/mute keys while the audio output is set to the monitor audio device to adjust volume/mute
        * In multi-monitor setups, Lunar can't detect which monitor audio device is selected so it will change the volume of the display that the cursor is on
- Many thanks to Hongfeng Xu (@Mic238) for helping me with extensive testing on these features!

- Keep Lunar in sync by reading the monitor's brightness and contrast periodically
- Remove all third party analytics and add a single request for counting unique users anonymously
    - This request sends a SHA256 hash of your device serial number to my server through a pubsub service

    - This makes the brightness/contrast change smoothly from a value to another, instead of jumping directly to that value
    - Check settings page to enable the option
    - I left it off by default because some monitors have a slow response time and smooth transitions end up not being so smooth

- The external monitor's brightness/contrast will still be kept within the configured per-monitor limits
- There are new configurable offsets on the settings page to make the synchronization perfect
